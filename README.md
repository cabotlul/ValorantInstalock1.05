# What is this?
This is an AutoHotkey script that instalocks all Valorant characters as fast as possible.


# Does this script work forever?
My script was made by me when there was only 12 agents in the game. If more agents are added or the character select screen is rearranged, then this will no longer work.


# How do you use it?
### Instructions:
 1. Download [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
 2. Run ``ValorantInstalock1.05.ahk`` 
 3. Queue up for a game
 4. Hold shift and press a shortcut key when the match found timer runs out
